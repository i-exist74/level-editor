# LevelEditor

Project I started about a month and a half ago. Current features include:

- Start a blank project
- Import and export leditor project files
- Edit geometry (only first layer is supported currently)
  - Includes paint, rect fill, and toggle functions for all objects that can be placed

All exported data should be compatible with the leditor and I don't think there's any problems with corrupting imported data, but if there is let me know.
