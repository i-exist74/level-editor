# LevelEditor

A little project I'm working on for fun. Current features include:

- Start a blank project
- Import and export leditor project files (should be completely compatible with editors that support the official editor project file format)
- Geometry editor
    - Includes most features that official-based level editors include, with a few extra degrees of user-friendliness and efficiency - try it for yourself!
    - Does NOT include: move level tool, copy backwards, mirror tool, dynamic display of cracks and shortcut entrances
